## Integration with Command Message Pattern Using WSO2 Integrator:BI

### Overview

The **Command Message** invokes a remote procedure via messages to receive a response.
This integration is built using **WSO2 Integrator:BI** to showcase the ease of implementing such patterns within a low-code integration environment.

For more detailed information on the **Command Message** pattern, visit the [Command Message documentation](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CommandMessage.html).
