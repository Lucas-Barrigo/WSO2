## Integration with Document Message Pattern Using WSO2 Integrator:BI

### Overview

The **Document Message** transfers data from one application to another. The focus is on the data and reliability, not on the timing of the transfer.
This integration is built using **WSO2 Integrator:BI** to showcase the ease of implementing such patterns within a low-code integration environment.

For more detailed information on the **Document Message** pattern, visit the [Document Message documentation](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/DocumentMessage.html).
