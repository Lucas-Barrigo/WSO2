## Integration with Message Sequence Pattern Using WSO2 Integrator:BI

### Overview

The **Message Sequence** pattern sends data as a sequence of messages and marks each message with sequence identification fields. 
This integration is built using **WSO2 Integrator:BI** to showcase the ease of implementing such patterns within a low-code integration environment.

For more detailed information on the **Message Sequence** pattern, visit the [Message Sequence documentation](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageSequence.html).
